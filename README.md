Cleps-Video-Player
==================

A simple (bloat-free) Video Player. Inspired by Kde's Dragon Player, Cleps is built on the idea that video players are viewing videos. Cleps does not claim to play exotic formats like Vlc or other players but simply play the ones that matter most. 

Cleps does not support Cd/Dvd i/o and will not transcode files. It depends on Qt5/Qt5 Multimedia and indirectly on gstreamer.
